You can move *up* ② and *down* ⑥, *select* ④ an option, or *stop* ①.



Scroll up and down with the <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> buttons, and choose an option with <kbd>Select</kbd>. If there are files named:
- obs1.py
- obs2.py
- obs3.py
- ftl1.py
- ftl2.py
- ftl3.py
- ftl4.py
- exp.py

you can run them from the menu. You can add a 3 or 5 second delay by choosing <kbd>Left</kbd> or <kbd>Right</kbd> instead of <kbd>Select</kbd>.
