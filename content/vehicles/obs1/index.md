Your task is to program the robot to work its way through the obstacle course, from Start to Finish 1.

You know how to make the robot move forwards, and how to make it turn on the spot, so getting through the obstacle course should be a matter of working out the sequence of moves and turns, and working out how far you need to move and turn each time.
