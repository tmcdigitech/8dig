- [Submission Template](FollowTheLine.pptx)

Using the color sensor, make your robot drive along the carpet until it reaches a white line.

Use the [Submission Template](FollowTheLine.pptx) to build your portfolio of evidence. You will need to include:
- a flowchart which lays out the sequence of steps the robot will go through to get through the course,
- the code you write which makes the robot do this,
- a video (taken with your laptop) of the robot successfully navigating the course.

Keep this file, as you'll use it again for subsequent parts of the Follow the Line task before uploading it to SEQTA.
